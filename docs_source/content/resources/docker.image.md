Image is responsible for pulling Docker images. It assumes that there is
already a Docker daemon running on the system.


## Example

```hcl
docker.image "busybox" {
  name    = "busybox"
  tag     = "latest"
  timeout = "60s"
}

```


## Parameters

- `name` (string)

  name of the image to pull

- `tag` (string)

  tag of the image to pull

- `timeout` (duration_string)

  the amount of time the pull will wait before halting forcefully. The
format is Go's duraction string. A duration string is a possibly signed
sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit
suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns",
"us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
