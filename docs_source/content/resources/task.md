Task allows you to run arbitrary shell commands on your system, first
checking if the command should be run.


## Example

```hcl
param "message" {
  default = "Hello, World!"
}

param "filename" {
  default = "test.txt"
}

task "render" {
  check = "cat {{param `filename`}} | tee /dev/stderr | grep -q '{{param `message`}}'"
  apply = "echo '{{param `message`}}' > {{param `filename`}}"
}

```


## Parameters

- `interpreter` (string)

  the shell interpreter that will be used for your scripts. `/bin/sh` is
used by default.

- `check_flags` (list of strings)

  flags to pass to the `interpreter` binary to check validity. For
`/bin/sh` this is `-n`

- `exec_flags` (list of strings)

  flags to pass to the interpreter at execution time

- `check` (string)

  the script to run to check if a resource needs to be changed. It should
exit with exit code 0 if the resource does not need to be changed, and
1 (or above) otherwise.

- `apply` (string)

  the script to run to apply the resource. Normal shell exit code
expectations apply (that is, exit code 0 for success, 1 or above for
failure.)

- `timeout` (duration string)

  the amount of time the command will wait before halting forcefully. The
format is Go's duraction string. A duration string is a possibly signed
sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit
suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns",
"us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

- `dir` (string)

  the working directory this command should be run in

- `env` (map of string to string)

  any environment variables that should be passed to the command


## Exported Fields

The following fields are available from other modules via `lookup`

- `CheckStmt` (string)

  the script that will be executed during planning.  It is the script provided
  to `check` with any template references resolved.

- `ApplyStmt` (string)

  the script that will be executed during application.  It is the script
  provided to `apply` with any template references resolved.

- `Dir` (string)

  the working directory of the script.  It will be an empty string if unset.

- `Env` (list of strings)

  a list of environment variables passed into the script with `env` in the form
  of `key=value`. If no environment variables were set then it returns an empty
  list.

- `Status` (command results)

  the execution status of the last task that was run.  During planning this will
  be the result of `check`, and during application it will be the result of
  `apply`.

- `CheckStatus` (command results)

  the status of the initial `check` run.  During planning this is equivivlent to
  `Status`, during application this will provide access to the results of the
  initial call to `check`.

### Command Results

The command results structure provides fields related to the execution status of
a task.  `Status` and `CheckStatus` both return command results type fields that
allow you to access any of these defined fields.

- `ExitStatus` (unsigned integer)

  the exit code of the process. The meaning of the fields is system dependent.

- `Stdout` (string)

  contains all data written to stdout by the process.

- `Stderr` (string)

  contains all data written to stderr by the process.
