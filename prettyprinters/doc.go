// Package prettyprinters provides a general interface and concrete
// implementations for implementing prettyprinters.  This package was originally
// created to facilitate the development of graphviz visualizations for resource
// graphs, however it is intended to be useful for creating arbitrary output
// generators so that resource graph data can be used in other applications.
//
// See the 'examples' directory for examples of using the prettyprinter, and see
// the 'graphviz' package for an example of a concrete implementation of
// DigraphPrettyPrinter.
